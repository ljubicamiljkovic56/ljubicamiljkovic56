### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ljubica MiljkoviÄ‡.
I'm Bachelor Computer Sowftare Engineer.
Currently, I'm striving to become frontend developer, but I'm also interested
in UX/UI design. 

My favorite programming languages/technologies/platforms are:
â€¢HTML/HTML5 
â€¢CSS/CSS3
â€¢JavaScript
â€¢jQuery
â€¢Bootstrap
â€¢WordPress

If you don't see me commiting on any repo, it's because of three things:
1. I'm working on WordPress web sites on InfinityFree
2. I'm having some health problems
3. Something else occured, life happens, I can't go against it
